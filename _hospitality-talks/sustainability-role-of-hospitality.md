title: Sustainability & Role of Hospitality
description: Sustainability or social responsibility is fast becoming a prime concern
  for public and private sectors and the hotel industry is no exception.  This topic
  has been debated for decades in hospitality and hoteliers are tasked with reducing
  the negative impact on the environment. Well executed sustainable practices make
  hospitality organizations stand out and provide a competitive advantage. In addition
  to natural resources, we also need to be mindful of social and economic resources
  and all these elements are inextricably linked. Tourism relies on the natural and
  cultural resources that attract tourists and act as the main driver of growth and
  development in the tourism economy. Hospitality organizations' success depends on
  preserving these attractions that compel tourists to visit these destinations and
  not doing so has major consequences. Our discussion today will help us better understand
  why sustainability is key for the future of the hospitality industry and why an
  immediate action is needed.
