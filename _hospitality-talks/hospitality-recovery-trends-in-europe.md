title: Hospitality Recovery Trends in Europe
description: The impacts of COVID-19 have been felt across industries all around the
  world. It has been devastating for the travel and tourism industry. Europe’s hospitality
  sector was the first to implement safety measures. However, it has also been a sector
  that has paid dearly as a result of the pandemic. As the hospitality sector stumbles
  from the effects of this global pandemic, the common discussion has shifted from
  simply “when will we recover?” – to “how will we recover?” Europe, a continent of
  50 countries of which 28 are members of European Union, is much more dependent on
  cross-border travel. Today’s discussion will focus on the challenges facing the
  European hospitality industry and if with these nuances, might Europe take longer
  to recover and what does the recovery look like.
