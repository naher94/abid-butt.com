title: Best strategies to deal with financial crisis in light of poor industry performance.
description: After a pandemic year, historical data does not necessarily help in predicting
  the future. As we look at the long and winding road of recovery, Sam-Erik Ruttmann
  and I are joined by a fabulous panel of professionals to discuss hotel performance
  and the resulting financial crisis. Please join Jan Freitag – National Director,
  Hospitality Market Analysis CoStar Group; Kevin M. Davis – Senior Managing Director,
  JLL Hotel & Hospitality Group and Jonathan Falik – Founder & CEO, JF Capital Advisors.
  What can the borrowers do to better prepare for the immediate future? How are lenders
  working with the borrowers and what financial products might be available to borrowers?
