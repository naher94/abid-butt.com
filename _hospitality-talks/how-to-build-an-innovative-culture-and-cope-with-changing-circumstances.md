title: How to build an innovative culture and cope with changing circumstances.
description: A culture conducive to innovation is not only good for a companyâ€™s bottom
  line. It also is something that both leaders and employees value in their organizations.
  Fixation on established paradigms, and practices, can severely limit the capability
  of organizations to change. This common practice jeopardizes the ability of organizations
  to keep up with changes in their environment. Couple this with today's customer
  journey that is more dynamic and unpredictable than ever. This operating environment
  presents many challenges for all stakeholders. Our session today will focus on how
  we develop sustainable competitiveness through innovation and winning culture.
