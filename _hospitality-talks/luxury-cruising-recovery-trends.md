title: Luxury Cruising – Recovery & Trends
description: The concept of cruising, which is essentially a ‘floating hotel / city,’
  is very unique even among other sub-sectors within the hospitality and tourism industry.
  Until recently, cruises were the fastest growing sector of the travel industry.
  According to the Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA), the number of cruise
  ship passengers has nearly doubled, in the last decade, to 30 million passengers
  and more than $150 billion is direct and indirect revenues. After a tumultuous couple
  of years as a result of the pandemic, cruise lines are setting their sails once
  again, but with some caveats and changes. The industry faces a long road back to
  normal as operators still have to contend with a patchwork of domestic and international
  rules, heightened environmental requirements, port infrastructure development and
  the sourcing of skilled crew.
