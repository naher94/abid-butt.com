title: Hotel Investments & Developments in Asia
description: Considered one of the largest continental economies in the world, Asia
  continues to rise in the global market. Tourism and hospitality industry plays a
  significant role, given the rapid socio-economic changes occurring in this region.
  Though not new to some short-term shocks, the COVID-19 pandemic has shifted the
  landscape of hospitality sector. The impact of SARS in 2003 was comparatively less
  severe on hotel performance and the business in key Asian cities rebounded strongly.
  Hotels in region are poised to recover from this pandemic and generally speaking,
  have recovered better than their European and American counterparts. As we refocus
  on recovery we need to take time to review business strategies and position for
  the eventual upturn. The hotel landscape will inevitably look different when the
  dust settles so an understanding of the evolving demand trends, efficiencies, and
  innovation will all be essential for future. Which country will recover at what
  pace depends on a number of factors. Our panelists today will help us understand
  the future of tourism and hotel development in this vibrant and diverse region.
