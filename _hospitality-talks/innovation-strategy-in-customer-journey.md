title: Innovation Strategy in Customer Journey
description: In today’s rapidly changing competitive world, organizations are becoming
  increasingly aware that their physical and financial assets only are not enough
  for generating competitive advantage. Complex challenges impact our personal and
  work lives and require innovation and creativity. Leaders need to understand how
  to design and guide effective collaborations to accelerate innovation and change.
  Designing the right customer experience is about composing an environment of customer
  engagement opportunities that reinforce brand values and encourage the desired customer
  behavior. The modern consumer had hundreds — if not thousands — of choices every
  day. What to read. Where to shop. What to buy. No matter how objective a customer’s
  purchasing process may seem, their analysis is influenced by their perception of
  your brand and your company. As customers become more demanding than ever before,
  their expectations for consistent, connected and personalized experiences are growing.
