title: European Lodging Investment Landscape
description: 'Together with tourism, the hospitality sector is the 3rd largest socio-economic
  activity in Europe. Hotels have become a prominent part of the real estate alongside
  the usual trio of commercial real estate asset classes: retail, office, and industrial.
  European hotel transaction volume had reached 27.1billion Euros in 2019 surpassing
  all previous records. Despite of the short-term challenges, fundamentals of the
  European hotel industry remain strong: key hotel markets such as London, Paris,
  and Rome are generally supply constrained and will continue to experience demand
  growth. There continues to be investor interest in hotels and the confidence in
  the long-term prospects for this sector.'
