title: Global Food & Dining Trends
description: 'Hospitality Talks had a wonderful conversation with a global panel that
  included Deepak Ohri – Chief Executive Officer, Lebua Hotels & Resorts; Ziad El
  Kerdany – Founder & Chief Executive Officer, Revel Hospitality and Matthew Jaffe
  – Managing Partner, Capital Burger. Our discussion revolved around consumer trends,
  behavior and global themes that are impacting the restaurants and dining venues.
  Being in an industry that serves up the most basic of human needs, "food", the foodservice
  industry has always been at the forefront of innovation. This industry continues
  to face several issues as food technology and consumer trends and demands keep changing. '
