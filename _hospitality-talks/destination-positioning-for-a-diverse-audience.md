title: Destination Positioning for a Diverse Audience
description: Tourism destinations are probably one of the most difficult “products”
  to market, involving large numbers of diverse stakeholders. In the highly competitive
  and dynamic global tourism environment, it is critical to develop a clear identity,
  or “brand” based on reality, while also reflecting the core strengths and “personality”.
  As competition among tourism destinations becomes more intense it has become increasingly
  more important to understand the dynamic structure of image by understanding elements
  that contribute to destination image formation. Attributes like natural resources,
  accessibility, exciting nightlife, restaurant variety, friendly locals, and safety,
  are significant predictors of visit intentions.
