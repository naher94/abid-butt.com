title: Operating Challenges in the New Normal
description: After a couple of tumultuous years, hospitality and lodging businesses
  have slowly reopened as the industry starts to recover. We might find that the old
  business model doesn’t fit the “new normal” During this process, several considerations
  must be applied, including the health and safety of guests, staff, and the community
  along with local regulations that govern these operations. We are thrilled to have
  three fabulous professionals from different parts of the world to share their thoughts
  regarding what to expect with business challenges and consumer behavior by exploring
  industry developments and expectations going forward.
