title: Changing Preferences of Hospitality Stakeholders
description: |-
  Stakeholder engagement is more important now than ever and all of us are trying to keep up with the changes. Active involvement is the key component to better understand expectations and develop needed initiatives. Todayâ€™s environment requires multiple stakeholders to balance possibly conflicting objectives through controversial decisions. Organizations need to be prepared for the changing roles of stakeholders and recognize that the stakeholder relationships deeply affect the business operations.

  Our conversation today will highlight the interdependencies in multi-stakeholder and multi-disciplinary landscape. The panelists will present a view from key stakeholder perspectives that includes owners, consumers, and workforce. We will also discuss how best to engage salient stakeholders by recognizing challenges, rationalizing changes needed and refashioning ways of working to protect interests of all those involved in the value creation process.
