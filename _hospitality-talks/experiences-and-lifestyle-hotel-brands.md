title: Experiences and Lifestyle Hotel Brands
description: Traveler preferences evolve and so do their perceptions. In the last
  few years, the hospitality industry has responded to these changes by developing
  new accommodation products that seek to fulfill customer needs through so-called
  lifestyle brand. As a result, the growth in hotel brands over the past decade has
  mainly been driven by the lifestyle category. These relatively new concepts are
  becoming powerful players in the industry. The availability of income-generating
  opportunities provided by facilities such as urban bars or cafeterias, meeting rooms
  available to locals or small spaces for special events play in their favor. Our
  guest today leads the lifestyle space globally and will help us understand the uniqueness
  of this segment.
