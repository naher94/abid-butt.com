title: State of the U.S. Lodging Industry & Outlook
description: We all know that the pandemic has been devastating to the hospitality
  industry with business travel essentially non-existent and recovery to 2019 levels
  projected in 2023/24. Leisure travel is expected to return first, particularly with
  vaccine distribution. Despite the hotel industry's challenges, the market is very
  optimistic with lodging REITs trading at parity while c-corps are better than pre-covid
  levels. In a recent interview FED Chair, Jerome Powell is projecting a strong rebound.
  Our panelists will help us understand these trends and implications for the US lodging
  sector.
