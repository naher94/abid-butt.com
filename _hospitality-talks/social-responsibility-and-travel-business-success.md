title: Social Responsibility and Travel Business Success
description: |
  As history can attest, well-meaning government and nonprofits aren't enough on their own to fix every societal issue. It is unlikely that we will find a silver bullet that single-handedly eradicate poverty, inequality, and infuse the workplace with jobs that make workers feel dignified and purposeful. As a result, the business landscape is changing. There has been an increased emphasis on stakeholder values, particularly social and environmental concerns, and a new way to define business success. Most companies have long practiced some form of corporate social and environmental responsibility with the broad goal, simply, of contributing to the well-being of the communities and society they affect and on which they depend. The rise of new forms of organization will require redefining the fundamental building blocks of business.

  For travel and tourism sector, “Sustainable tourism was largely defined on the concept of doing no harm,” new movement of Regenerative tourism builds on that concept and explores opportunities for tourism to improve the destination and leaving it better than you found it. Thoughts like “our obligation to the destinations we visit" are becoming mainstream.
