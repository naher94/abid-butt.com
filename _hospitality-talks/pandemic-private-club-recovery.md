title: Pandemic & Private Club Recovery
description: 'The allure of a private, members-only club has attracted consumers for
  years. Whilst the hospitality industry has been hit the hardest with pandemic, this
  segment of the industry is thriving. Clubs operate with recurring revenue models
  creating fixed income from members.  During recovery clubs continue to evaluate
  their operations for “governance, amenities and people” as they try to determine
  how to deliver on the needs and wishes of their current and prospective members
  and how to better innovate and engage with their communities. How will this subscription
  model and exclusionary environment survive with the changing social norms? Will
  the hotel industry embrace subscription model and present more competition? '
