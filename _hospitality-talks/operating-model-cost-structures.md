title: Operating Model & Cost Structures
description: In the hospitality industry, customer service is the name of the game.
  The challenge, of course, is in controlling costs while keeping customer service
  high. For hoteliers who want to maximize their revenues and return on investment,
  controlling costs are top of mind. Measuring cost efficiency provides useful information
  on the performance of hotels to management, and all stakeholders. The industry has
  always relied on occupancy percentage, RevPar, margin percentage etc to evaluate
  hotel performance. Are these measures still valid? What needs to be done to measure
  the complete picture of performance.
