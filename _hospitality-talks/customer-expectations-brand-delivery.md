title: Customer Expectations & Brand Delivery
description: "Hotel customer experience has never been more important as connected
  and empowered, customer’s expectations are rising. We all know that travel and hospitality
  is the second most customer centric sector, 2nd only to healthcare. Knowing customers’
  expectations is critical to all businesses and brand positioning impacts customer
  expectations, which in turn have an impact on customer satisfaction. A brand is
  a network of associations between your customers, employees, and other stakeholders
  and the feelings and emotions it evokes when interacting with it. For most companies
  brand is one of the most important intellectual assets. \n\nWhat is the role of
  brand in customer experience and how has the pandemic changed customer expectations?
  Are hospitality brands really customer centric? What are the customer motivations
  beyond price and quality? Will the customers abandon the brands that don’t support
  their values? \n"
