title: Africa’s Hotel Industry – Growth & Development
description: "Africa is the second fastest growing tourism market in the world now
  and its immense tourism potential is just starting to be unlocked. The Africa’s
  hotel industry, relative to the rest of the world, is still at is infancy, is being
  transformed with not only more local investors developing the hospitality sector,
  but also foreign investments are also keen to have presence in this market.\n\nAfrica
  enjoyed some respite as one of the last regions to see an outbreak of COVID-19,
  but the region and the sector has faced the full impact of the pandemic since the
  beginning of the year. The continent has managed the pandemic well from a public
  health perspective, possibly drawing on lessons learned from other health crises.
  Travel and tourism sector, one of the key growth drivers and contributing more than
  8% to the continents GDP, continues to face typical challenges as a result of closed
  border.\n\nWe must also emphasize that Africa is gigantic, vast and diverse land
  mass; 54 nations, surrounded by two oceans – the Atlantic and Indian and the Mediterranean
  Sea to the North, world’s second largest and second most-populous continent. It’s
  not one country. While there are some common patterns, it’s difficult to overlook
  local and regional nuances. \n"
