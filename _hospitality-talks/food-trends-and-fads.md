description: 'Dining trends have evolved, but at a slower pace, until the pandemic.
  The industry finds itself in a new era of foodservice and hospitality adapting to
  new demands and challenges. In the age of food network, Tik Tok and Instagram consumer
  expectations and demands are ever changing. Online search trends drive the restaurantsâ€™
  offering as consumers using third party delivery services search for type of menu
  rather than a specific chains. These changes can be overwhelming with new business
  models surfacing rapidly. '
