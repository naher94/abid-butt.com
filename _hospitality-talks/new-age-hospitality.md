title: New Age Hospitality
description: |
  A hotel concept integrates various elements of hotel services and facilities into a compelling offering for their targeted customers and a unique story is created through what a hotel looks like, how it presents and markets itself. It wasn’t all that long ago that we all were still wondering if we needed to invest further in internet infrastructure. In a period where online guest reviews and social media define the magnitude of success, the traditional rooms selling, and breakfast might not accurately reflect travelers’ expectations. The questions now involve; if the hotels should be retailers, neighborhood gathering places, co-working and co-living spaces or galleries. As a result, the next decade will bring with it a number of disrupting trends and events that will change the “hotel” definition.

  This discussion will help us understand these trends and gain a better understanding of what goes into a hotel concept, and how different elements come together so that these innovations and concepts stand out from the crowd.
