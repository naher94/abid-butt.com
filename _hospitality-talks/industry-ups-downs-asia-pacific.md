title: Industry Ups & Downs â€“ Asia Pacific
description: Though Asia generally kept the infection rates low throughout 2020, arrival
  of delta variant forced many Southeast Asian countries to contend with big outbreaks.
  In 2019 the tourism sector contributed more than $390 billion in the regional economies,
  and it is no surprise that many of these nations are keen to open the borders to
  travelers. Almost every day, in October, countries across Asia have revealed plans
  to loosen pandemic-induced restrictions on inbound tourism.  India, Singapore, Thailand,
  Indonesia, Fiji and Australia are only a few of the markets announcing their plans
  to welcome mostly vaccinated visitors. Maldives and Sri Lanka were early in opening
  their borders. With ever changing requirements and lack of clarity on the local
  conditions to gain consumer confidence, restarting tourism might prove to be harder
  than shutting it down was.
