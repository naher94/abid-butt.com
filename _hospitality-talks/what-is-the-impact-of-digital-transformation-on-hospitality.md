title: What is the impact of digital transformation on hospitality
description: Hospitality technology may be the most amazing transition to occur in
  the hospitality industry over recent years. The widespread adoption of new technologies
  in this industry has fundamentally reshaped the way in which services are provided
  and received. Technology has helped speed up operations and helped make the process
  much more efficient and possibly more enjoyable for the consumers. There are few
  industries that implement technologies as complex or diverse as those installed
  in the hospitality industry. From different types of facilities to different service
  providers specializing in one area, managing hospitality technology is quite challenging
  to navigate through, it is not surprising that frustrations and failures often arise.
  Our esteemed panel today will help us better understand the impact of digital transformation
  on the hospitality industry and how do we transition from “data rich to information
  rich” industry.
